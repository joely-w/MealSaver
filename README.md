To deploy this code, you'll need to clone the repo, then navigate into it using your command line. From there navigate into `api` and run `npm install`. You'll then need to create an environment file in the `api` folder called `.env` with the following data (insert your own database info 🕶️):
```
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_USERNAME=root

```
You can then run `npm run start` from the `api` folder and access the app from `https://localhost:3001`
